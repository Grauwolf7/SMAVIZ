# SMAVIZ: Interactive and Playful Visualizations of String-Matching Algorithms

Bachelor's Thesis at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Institute for System Software

## 📝 About
SMAVIZ is an interactive web-based visualization tool designed to help students learn and understand string-matching algorithms. The tool provides step-by-step visualizations of various algorithms including:
- Naive Search
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
- Rabin-Karp
- Aho-Corasick

## 🎯 Key Features
- Interactive visualizations of multiple string search algorithms
- Step-by-step animation capabilities
- Custom input strings and patterns
- Performance comparison between different algorithms
- Context-sensitive help system with mascot "Frogbert Algorithmicus"
- Interactive learning modes for algorithm understanding

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Vue.js
- D3.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## 📚 Thesis Details
- **Author:** Kilian Wolfinger
- **Advisor:** Dipl.-Ing. Dr. Markus Weninger, BSc
- **Institution:** Institute for System Software, Johannes Kepler University Linz
- **Submission Date:** October 2024
